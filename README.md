# EfficientNet-Based-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Binary-class-Image-Classification-

## Introduction
This project harnesses the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically focusing on the EfficientNet architecture, to effectively classify images into two categories: buildings and forests. The primary application of this technology lies in resource management in arid regions, like Saudi Arabia, where distinguishing between vegetation and urban areas is crucial for sustainable development and environmental preservation. By fine-tuning pre-trained CNN models, this project addresses challenges related to limited data availability, computational resources, and time constraints, making it a viable solution for real-world environmental monitoring and management.
